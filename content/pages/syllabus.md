**Participation:** This is assessed by attendance, participation in class discussion and activity, and work with partners.

**Problem Definition**: Answer questions on a worksheet.

**Journal**: The design journal is a documentation of your process, from thought to prototyping. It should include visual and verbal documentation of research, development, and thinking. Each week, you should respond to any reading, conversation, or other input, and reflect on how it has changed your perspective. 

**Project Proposal**: This is a group assignment that will take the form of a written document and a presentation. The following sections should be included in the written document:

*   Introduction and problem statement
*   Literature review
*   Design philosophy
*   Proposed methods
*   Limitations

Presentations should be approximately 10 minutes long and tell a compelling story about your project.

**Final Presentation**: Prototypes should be documented in an appropriate form (website, video, etc.). Presentations should tell the story of the process and outcome.

**Design Book**: The design book is the documentation of your process from beginning to end. This can take the form of a website, a book, or anything else that represents your process. Design books should tell a compelling story about how you arrived at your completed prototype, and document all the important decision points along the way.
